## Purpose
There are already tons of design pattern learning resources on the web, but I can't only learning by reading, right? In software development field, the best way to learn one thing is by doing it yourself. 

Aside from this, I found almost all the resources are written in ES5. ES6 has out for awhile, and it's not a problem anymore since we have transpilers like Babel, TypeScript or CoffeeScript..., so, **by the power of module and class, let's classify all the things**!!!

By the way, I write this base on [Learning JavaScript Design Patterns](https://github.com/addyosmani/essential-js-design-patterns), it really helps me out from the muddy crappy structure I had.
